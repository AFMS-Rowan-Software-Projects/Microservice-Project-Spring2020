# Microservice-Project-Spring2020
ASRC Federal Mission Solutions is in the process of evaluating some of our larger programs for decomposition into microservices. The team will start with a single, monolithic application of their choosing and decompose it into a group of microservices that provide the same functionality.  The solution will leverage Docker Containers for the runtime environment. The teamâ€™s experience and recommendations will provide valuable insights for AFMS into software decomposition process.
